## UV

**UV** is a modern package manager used to install dependencies and manage Python packages. It can also be used to run Python files or entire projects.

* **Similar to pip?**
  Yes, it serves the same purpose as `pip`, but it is significantly faster.

* **Why is it faster?**
  UV is implemented in **Rust**, which leverages low-level, highly optimized code (including C under the hood). This allows UV to install dependencies roughly **10× faster than pip**.

## Dependency Management Files

* **`pyproject.toml`**
  Manages high-level (direct) dependencies of the application.

* **`uv.lock`**
  Locks and manages low-level dependencies, including **nested/transitive dependencies**, ensuring consistent and reproducible builds.

## Project Structure Overview

* **`data/`**
  Stores all data-related files such as uploaded files, processed data, or generated artifacts.
  This directory is ideal for integration with **AWS S3**.

* **`templates/`**
  Contains frontend templates.

* **`static/`**
  Holds static assets such as **CSS files**.

* **`notebook/`**
  Used for experimentation, including **RAG**, evaluations, and exploratory work.

* **`tests/`**
  Contains unit tests to validate application functionality.

* **`multi_doc_chat/`** (Main GenAI application)

  1. **`config/`** – All configuration-related files
  2. **`exception/`** – Custom exception handling
  3. **`logger/`** – Application logging (automatically configured for **AWS CloudWatch**)
  4. **`prompts/`** – All prompt templates
  5. **`utils/`** – Utility/helper functions
  6. **`src/`** – Core application components such as data ingestion, retrieval, and processing logic

## Recommended Study Order

Follow this sequence to understand the project step by step:

1. `notebook/RAG.ipynb`

2. Logger: `multi_doc_chat/logger/custom_logger.py`

3. Exception handling: `multi_doc_chat/exception/custom_exception.py`

4. Configuration: `multi_doc_chat/config/config.yaml`

5. Utilities:

   * `multi_doc_chat/utils/config_loader.py`
     → Loads `config.yaml` and converts it into a dictionary
   * `multi_doc_chat/utils/model_loader.py`
     → Loads the model and embeddings
   * `multi_doc_chat/utils/file_io.py`
     → Creates session IDs, directories, handles file uploads, and more
   * `multi_doc_chat/utils/document_ops.py`
     → Loads documents and extracts their content

6. Data ingestion:
   `multi_doc_chat/src/document_ingestion/data_ingestion.py`

7. Retrieval logic:
   `multi_doc_chat/src/document_chat/retrieval.py`

8. Evaluation notebook:
   `notebook/evaluations.ipynb`

9. **Confident AI** for RAG evaluations

## Adding a New Package

To add a new dependency, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to `requirements.txt`
2. Run:

   ```bash
   uv add -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Sync dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

   This will update and lock the dependencies in `uv.lock`.


JenKins steps

1. Run jenkins on local uing docker compose
```bash 
docker compose -f docker-compose.jenkins.yml up -d
```
2. Assess jenkins in browser, localhost:8083
3. Run below command to Get Password 
    docker exec jenkins-local cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
4. Setup first admin
    username: sonu
    pwd: sonu123
